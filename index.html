            <div class="front">Israel and Iran used to be allies</div>
            <div class="back">Before the 1979 revolution, Iran and Israel had a surprisingly warm relationship. Iran was one of the first Muslim-majority nations to recognize Israel and even supplied it with oil. Israel had an embassy in Tehran, and the two nations collaborated strategically and economically. This era of alliance is a sharp contrast to the current hostility, showing how geopolitical tides can turn completely. That former closeness now makes today’s enmity all the more intense.</div>

            <div class="back">When the Shah was overthrown in 1979, Iran didn’t just change leaders—it changed foundations. The monarchy gave way to a theocracy led by Ayatollah Khomeini, who built the state around strict Shia Islamic principles. Religion wasn’t just a private belief anymore—it became the political and moral backbone of the country. Israel, once an ally, was rebranded as a corrupting, godless force in opposition to Islamic justice. In this new worldview, hostility toward Israel wasn’t just strategic—it was sacred.</div>

Initiated by Khomeini in 1979, the event features state-sponsored marches, speeches, and chants of “Death to Israel.” It serves as a symbol of the regime’s enduring ideological stance and mobilizes anti-Israel sentiment at home and abroad. While dismissed by some as propaganda, Quds Day reveals how deeply the Israel conflict is embedded in Iran’s political identity.</div>

            <div class="front">Iran began a nuclear program after its war with Iraq.</div>
            <div class="back">After the devastating Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Iran sought to rebuild and modernize. One major goal was energy independence, and nuclear power seemed like a promising path. Iran claimed its intentions were peaceful—focused on generating electricity and supporting scientific progress. However, the opaque nature of the program raised suspicions. From the start, the world questioned whether there was more to the effort than just energy.</div>

            <div class="front">Iran built machines to make powerful nuclear fuel.</div>
            <div class="back">To run a nuclear program, Iran developed centrifuges to enrich uranium, the process needed for fuel. These machines increased the concentration of uranium-235, which is used for both power plants and—at higher levels—nuclear weapons. Over time, Iran installed thousands of centrifuges across the country. Some of its enrichment sites were built deep underground, which made inspections harder. This secrecy only increased global concerns.</div>

            <div class="back">Israel viewed Iran’s nuclear program as a potential threat from the beginning. Officials believed Iran’s fuel-making could be secretly diverted to develop a nuclear weapon. They also doubted Iran’s willingness to follow international rules, especially after discovering hidden facilities. This mistrust fueled calls for sanctions and even preemptive strikes. For Israel, the threat wasn’t just political—it was existential.</div>

            <div class="back">The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 between Iran and six major world powers. Its goal was to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons by placing strict limits on its program. Iran agreed to reduce uranium enrichment, limit heavy water research, and cap its stockpiles. Restrictions were also placed on centrifuge use and enrichment levels. In return, many nuclear-related sanctions were lifted.</div>

            <div class="back">Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor both known and suspected nuclear sites. These inspections were some of the most intrusive ever negotiated in a non-proliferation agreement. They helped verify Iran’s compliance and build international trust. Over time, however, tensions would rise as Iran’s cooperation began to wane. The access issue became a key point of contention.</div>

This clause was intended to keep pressure on Iran and deter any backsliding. It allowed any of the deal's signatories to trigger the return of sanctions without needing a UN Security Council vote. The mechanism would remain active for ten years. While it offered leverage, its real-world effectiveness remains debated.</div>

He argued the deal had sunset clauses that allowed Iran to resume nuclear activities in the future. The move shocked America’s allies and triggered a new wave of sanctions. It also marked a major shift in U.S. foreign policy. The deal’s collapse accelerated tensions across the region.</div>

            <div class="front">U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites raised cyberwar stakes.</div>
            <div class="back">Recent U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities weren’t limited to physical targets—they also escalated tensions in the cyber domain. These operations demonstrated that future warfare might involve coordinated digital attacks alongside airstrikes. By disabling defenses or gathering data ahead of physical strikes, cyber tools became vital to the mission. Iran responded with its own cyber efforts, deepening the virtual conflict. As these attacks evolved, both sides crossed new thresholds in cyberwar strategy.</div>

            <div class="back">Israel’s early entry into cyber warfare gave it the upper hand in its fight against Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Before physical damage could even be considered, cyberattacks quietly disrupted Iran’s enrichment timelines. Israel’s first moves caught Iran off guard, forcing them into a defensive cyber posture. This early momentum gave Israel a long-term edge in managing and escalating the conflict on its terms. Their leadership in cyber capabilities became a model for other nations.</div>

These attacks appeared as unexplained explosions at nuclear sites, often hitting without warning and leaving Iran’s technicians baffled. In some cases, Israeli operatives even planted bombs inside machinery parts before they were shipped to Iran. These cyber-physical attacks delayed Iran’s progress without the need for airstrikes.

Secret missions helped delay Iran’s progress by removing key scientists, sabotaging facilities, and stealing nuclear data.

Operation Narnia reportedly focused on systematically eliminating top nuclear experts, including those who had worked on weaponization for decades.

In several cases, scientists were killed in their homes or vehicles without signs of an assailant.

It played a vital role in expanding Tehran’s reach into the Levant and threatening Israel directly. But Israeli operations have dealt it severe blows, including assassinations and supply-line disruptions. Hezbollah now faces internal political pressures in Lebanon, along with rising Israeli precision strikes. Its dominance has slipped under the weight of Israeli countermeasures.</div>

Sanctions, wars, and isolation haven’t changed this view—they’ve refined it. Nuclear negotiations are not signs of surrender but tools to gain time. This strategy, forged during the Iran-Iraq war and refined by years of Western pressure, is driven not by ideology but by hardened survival instincts.</div>

Its goal is not to replicate Iran’s Islamic system abroad, but to support movements that resist U.S. or Israeli influence.

            <div class="back">During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq launched Scud missiles toward Israel. To defend its ally, the United States deployed Patriot missile batteries to intercept incoming threats. This event marked a milestone in U.S.-Israel military coordination. It also helped pave the way for today’s close missile defense cooperation. The deployment was both symbolic and strategic.</div>

Arguments include the desire for greater independence and avoiding political strings attached to aid. Others argue that continued U.S. support is essential given regional threats.
